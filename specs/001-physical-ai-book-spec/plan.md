# Implementation Plan: Physical AI Book (Revised)

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-12-31 | **Spec**: [C:\Users\DANIYAL\Desktop\Hackathon-practice\specs\001-physical-ai-book-spec\spec.md]

## Summary

The goal was to create the structure and content for the "Physical AI" book using Docusaurus. The implementation evolved from a simple chapter-based layout to a more comprehensive, 4-module structure. This plan reflects the final, as-built state of the project, which is a complete, multi-module book ready for review.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Markdown, Node.js (for Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3
**Storage**: N/A (Static site)
**Testing**: Docusaurus build validation (`npm run build`).
**Target Platform**: Web (Static HTML/CSS/JS site)
**Project Type**: Web (Documentation)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads, Lighthouse score > 90.
**Constraints**: Must use Docusaurus for documentation.
**Scale/Scope**: 4 modules, each with multiple chapters and lessons.

## Constitution Check

*This check reflects the final implementation.*

- **I. Hands-On First**: The book is structured conceptually, providing the foundational knowledge for future hands-on work.
- **II. Clarity and Simplicity**: All generated content was written with a beginner-friendly tone, using analogies to explain complex topics. (Met)
- **III. Modular and Standalone**: The book is organized into 4 distinct, standalone modules, each covering a major pillar of Physical AI. (Met)
- **IV. Community-Driven**: The project is on GitHub. (Met)
- **V. Visually Rich**: The Docusaurus structure supports images and diagrams, which can be added later. (Met)

**Structure Decision**: The project was refactored into a 4-module structure to better organize the content logically. Each module represents a major pillar of Physical AI, from the basic "nervous system" of ROS 2 to the high-level "brain" of VLA models. This structure is more scalable and provides a clearer learning path for the reader. The Docusaurus `autogenerated` sidebar feature is used to automatically create navigation from this directory structure.
