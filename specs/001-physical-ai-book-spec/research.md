# Research: Physical AI Book

**Date**: 2025-12-27

## Summary

This document outlines the research performed for the "Physical AI Book" project.

## Technical Research

### Docusaurus
- **Decision**: Use Docusaurus v2 as the static site generator.
- **Rationale**: Docusaurus is the specified technology in the project constraints. It is well-suited for documentation sites, provides a good structure for books, and has excellent features like auto-generating sidebars, search, and theming. It's a mature and well-documented tool, so no major technical unknowns are anticipated.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - **GitBook**: Another popular tool for creating online books, but Docusaurus is more flexible and is the required tool for this project.
  - **Jekyll**: A general-purpose static site generator, but would require more custom development to achieve the desired book-like structure.
