# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Vision
To be the most accessible and practical guide for beginners and intermediate learners to understand and apply Physical AI concepts through hands-on projects and clear, concise documentation.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On First
Every concept must be accompanied by a practical, hands-on example or tutorial. The goal is to learn by doing, not just by reading.

### II. Clarity and Simplicity
Explain complex topics in simple terms. Avoid jargon where possible, and explain it clearly when necessary. The content should be accessible to a non-expert audience.

### III. Modular and Standalone
Each chapter and section should be as modular as possible, allowing readers to jump in and out of topics of interest without needing to read the entire book linearly.

### IV. Community-Driven
The project thrives on community contributions. We encourage feedback, bug reports, and content suggestions to continuously improve the book.

### V. Visually Rich
Use diagrams, illustrations, and videos to explain concepts. A picture is worth a thousand words, especially in a technical context.

## Success Criteria
- High community engagement (e.g., GitHub stars, forks, contributions).
- Positive reader feedback and reviews.
- The book is used as a primary learning resource in at least one workshop or course.
- The content is fully documented and published using Docusaurus.

## Constraints
- The primary technology for documentation and publishing is Docusaurus.
- All content must be licensed under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT or Creative Commons).
- The scope is limited to Physical AI for beginners and intermediate learners. Advanced topics are out of scope for the first version.

## Stakeholders
- **Authors & Contributors:** The primary creators of the content.
- **Readers:** The target audience for the book.
- **Docusaurus Team:** The maintainers of the underlying technology.
- **AI Community:** The broader community that benefits from the book.

## Brand Voice
- **Tone:** Encouraging, patient, and enthusiastic.
- **Style:** Clear, concise, and direct.
- **Personality:** A helpful guide and a knowledgeable friend.
