# Lesson 1.1: What is Physical AI?

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of the Physical AI book! In this lesson, we will explore the fundamental question: What is Physical AI? We will define the term, look at some real-world examples, and understand the core components that make up a Physical AI system.

## Core Concept

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI that exists only in computer simulations or on the internet, Physical AI has a body and can affect its environment.

The key components of a Physical AI system are:

-   **Sensors**: These are the "senses" of the AI, allowing it to gather information about the world. Examples include cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, and GPS receivers.
-   **Actuators**: These are the "muscles" of the AI, enabling it to take action. Examples include motors, speakers, lights, and robotic arms.
-   **Compute**: This is the "brain" of the AI, where it processes information from the sensors and decides what actions to take with the actuators. This can range from a simple microcontroller to a powerful cloud-based AI model.

## Hands-On Example

Think about a common smart home device: a thermostat.

-   **Sensor**: It has a temperature sensor to perceive the current room temperature.
-   **Compute**: It has a small computer that compares the current temperature to your desired temperature.
-   **Actuator**: It controls the heating or cooling system to adjust the temperature.

This simple device embodies the core principles of Physical AI.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Physical AI is about creating intelligent systems that can interact with the real world. You also learned about the three core components of any Physical AI system: sensors, actuators, and compute. In the next lesson, we will build our very first Physical AI system!
